### **Route Management (1 minute)**
1. **Show "Pending Routes" section**
2. **"Look! A new route was just created for Apollo Hospital!"**
3. **Highlight route details**:
   - From: Chennai Central Blood Bank
   - To: Apollo Hospitals Chennai
   - Distance: 12.3 km
   - Predicted ETA: 45 minutes
4. **Click "Start Route"**
5. **Show route status change**: "Route is now active!"
6. **Navigate to "Active Routes"**
7. **Show progress tracking**: "Real-time updates as we move along the route"

### **Delivery Completion (30 seconds)**
1. **Simulate route progress** (use admin simulation if needed)
2. **Show progress bar updating**: "Route progress: 75%"
3. **Click "Mark as Delivered"**
4. **Show completion**: "Route completed successfully!"

## üîÑ **REAL-TIME DEMONSTRATION (2 minutes)**

### **Cross-Laptop Synchronization**
1. **"Watch how all three systems update in real-time!"**
2. **On Hospital Laptop**: "Request status changed from 'created' to 'approved' to 'en_route'"
3. **On Blood Bank Laptop**: "Active delivery appeared with real-time progress"
4. **On Driver Laptop**: "Route status and progress updating live"

### **AI Intelligence Highlights**
1. **"The AI automatically found the best blood bank based on:"**
   - Distance optimization
   - Blood availability
   - Expiry risk assessment
   - Urgency matching
2. **"ML confidence scores help prioritize requests"**
3. **"Real-time ETA predictions based on traffic and route conditions"**

### **Emergency Response System**
1. **"This system can handle multiple emergency requests simultaneously"**
2. **"AI automatically routes multiple deliveries efficiently"**
3. **"Real-time tracking prevents delays and saves lives"**
